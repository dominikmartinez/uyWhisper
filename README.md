# uyWhisper 
Finetuning [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) on Portunhol data

## Project
This repository contains the code and report written within the scope of the course *Programming Project* at the Department of Computational Linguistics of the University of Zurich. 

## Dependencies
For a hassle-free installation process, I provide a [requirements](requirements.txt) file. Further, you'll need [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). 

## Code
While the project could not achieve its primary goal, the [report](report.pdf) still holds valuable information regarding possible challenges. Also, regarding the usage of the source code, consult the report and the code itself. 

## Future of the project
Despite the current idle state of the project, I intend to resume development by the end of 2024 and to further enrich this codebase and its documentation.
